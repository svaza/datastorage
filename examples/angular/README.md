This App demonstrates sample angular implementation

- You can find 2 scenarios which demonstrates how the key is observed
    - In a component with OnPush change detection strategy, using async pipe it works seamlessly - component1
    - In a component with default change detection, this requires manual subscription and unsubscription when component destroys - component2

Both usecases stands good, if they are applied for right purpose.
